                The Viral Bloom, scientifically known as Cindathinoes, is a mesmerizing, ocean creature discovered by underwater diver researchers in the deep oceans of Japan. Belonging to the Anthozoan family, it resembles a vibrant coral with fluid tendrils that pulse and flow in real-time, mimicking the graceful movement of sea anemones. Its colorful form is in constant motion, expanding and retracting like a living organism reacting to its environment. What sets the Viral Bloom apart is its dynamic defense mechanism—when approached by a human, it turns black as a defense.

                <span class="yellow">Guidelines for human interaction with this creature</span> The Viral Bloom reacts to user presence in real time. Move your cursor near it to trigger a defensive response—its arms will move as if sensing danger. For a more dramatic change, click to cause mutations that alter its color. Move slowly and observe how it adapts to your behavior. Each action influences it.
